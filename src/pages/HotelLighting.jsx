  { id: "hl1", question: "How does hotel lighting affect the guest experience?", answer: "Lighting is arguably the most critical element in hotel design. It dictates the ambiance, sets the mood upon check-in, guides guests through corridors, and provides comfort in the guestrooms. High-quality lighting with proper color temperature and dimming controls can significantly enhance perceived luxury and guest satisfaction." },
  { id: "hl2", question: "What is the recommended color temperature for hotel lobbies?", answer: "We generally recommend a warm color temperature between 2700K and 3000K for hotel lobbies to create a welcoming, luxurious atmosphere. During daytime, dynamic tunable white systems can adjust the temperature to match natural daylight (up to 4000K), gradually warming up as evening approaches." },
  { id: "hl3", question: "Do you supply customized decorative fixtures for hotels?", answer: "Yes. In addition to architectural lighting, we work with premium European and regional brands to supply bespoke decorative chandeliers, pendants, and wall sconces tailored specifically to the interior designer's vision." },
  { id: "hl4", question: "How can we reduce energy costs in our hotel lighting?", answer: "By upgrading to high-efficiency LED fixtures and implementing smart lighting controls (such as DALI or Casambi). Occupancy sensors in corridors and daylight harvesting in lobbies can reduce lighting energy consumption by up to 60% without compromising the guest experience." }

The moment a guest steps into a hotel, the lighting sets the tone for their entire stay. A poorly lit lobby feels sterile; an overly bright restaurant feels like a cafeteria. At Credence Lighting, we understand that luxury is defined by nuances: the perfect grazing angle on a textured wall, the complete absence of glare, and the seamless transition from day to night." },
