  { id: "facade1", question: "Do you offer programmable media facades?", answer: "Yes, we specialize in high-resolution LED pixel nodes and linear media tubes that can turn any building facade into a dynamic video display or programmable light show." },
  { id: "facade2", question: "Are your facade fixtures weather-resistant?", answer: "Absolutely. All our exterior facade lighting products are rated IP66 or IP67, built with marine-grade materials to withstand extreme temperatures, sand, and humidity in the Middle East." },
  { id: "facade3", question: "Can facade lighting be energy efficient?", answer: "We utilize the latest high-efficacy LED technology paired with intelligent control systems. By programming schedules and dimming levels, we ensure your building stands out while minimizing energy consumption." },
  { id: "facade4", question: "How do you handle maintenance for high-rise facades?", answer: "We design with maintenance in mind. We use fixtures with long lifespans (up to 100,000 hours) and modular designs. We also offer DALI and DMX systems with remote monitoring to detect faults before they become visible issues." }
