  { id: "rest1", question: "Why is lighting so important in a restaurant?", answer: "Lighting defines the dining atmosphere. It affects everything from how appetizing the food looks to how long guests decide to stay. Good restaurant lighting creates an intimate, comfortable space that encourages guests to relax, while poor lighting can make a space feel frantic or uninviting." },
  { id: "rest2", question: "What is Warm Dimming technology?", answer: "Warm Dimming (or Dim-to-Warm) mimics the behavior of traditional halogen bulbs. As you dim the LED fixture, the color temperature automatically shifts from a crisp 3000K down to a very warm, candle-like 1800K. This is essential for restaurants transitioning from a bright lunch service to an intimate dinner setting." },
  { id: "rest3", question: "How do you highlight tables without blinding guests?", answer: "We use deep-recessed, narrow-beam pinhole downlights positioned directly over the tables. The light source is hidden deep within the ceiling, ensuring zero glare at eye level, while the beam punches down to illuminate the food and the table surface." },
  { id: "rest4", question: "Do you provide decorative pendants and wall lights for cafes?", answer: "Yes, we supply a wide range of decorative lighting from premium international brands. We can also assist in sourcing bespoke, custom-manufactured decorative pieces based on the interior designer's concepts." }
