  { id: "rtl1", question: "How does lighting affect retail sales?", answer: "Lighting directly impacts consumer behavior. High-contrast accent lighting draws attention to premium merchandise, while high color rendering (CRI) ensures products look vibrant and appealing. Proper lighting guides customer flow through the store and increases dwell time, which correlates directly with increased sales." },
  { id: "rtl2", question: "What is CRI and why is it important for shops?", answer: "CRI (Color Rendering Index) measures how accurately a light source reveals true colors. In retail environments—especially fashion, jewelry, and cosmetics—a CRI of 90 or higher is essential. It ensures that fabrics and materials look exactly as the designer intended, preventing customer dissatisfaction and returns." },
  { id: "rtl3", question: "What is the best lighting system for changing store layouts?", answer: "Magnetic track systems and standard 3-circuit track lighting are the most versatile solutions for retail. They allow store managers to easily add, remove, or reposition spotlights as seasonal displays and floor layouts change, without needing an electrician." },
  { id: "rtl4", question: "Can you supply lighting for multi-location retail rollouts?", answer: "Yes, we specialize in brand rollouts. We ensure consistent lighting quality, exact color temperatures, and standardized fixture aesthetics across all your retail branches in the UAE and the wider GCC region." }
