  { id: "rl1", question: "Do you provide lighting design for private villas?", answer: "Yes, we specialize in high-end residential and villa lighting design. Our team works closely with homeowners, architects, and interior designers to create custom lighting layouts that enhance the architectural beauty and comfort of luxury homes." },
  { id: "rl2", question: "Can you integrate the lighting with smart home systems?", answer: "Absolutely. We supply and commission smart lighting controls (such as Casambi, DALI, and KNX) that seamlessly integrate with major smart home ecosystems, allowing you to control scenes, dimming, and scheduling from your smartphone or wall panels." },
  { id: "rl3", question: "What is the best lighting for a villa's landscape?", answer: "For landscape lighting, we recommend IP65/IP67 rated fixtures that are highly durable against the UAE's heat and humidity. Using a combination of tree uplights, pathway bollards, and subtle wall grazers creates a beautiful, secure, and inviting outdoor environment at night." },
  { id: "rl4", question: "How do we hide the light fixtures in our living room ceiling?", answer: "We use trimless, deep-recessed downlights and hidden linear LED profiles in cove ceilings. This 'glare-free' approach ensures that the room is beautifully illuminated without the actual light source being visible to the eye." }
