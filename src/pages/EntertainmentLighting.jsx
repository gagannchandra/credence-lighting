  { id: "ent1", question: "Do you provide DMX-controlled lighting for entertainment venues?", answer: "Yes, we specialize in DMX512 and SPI protocols for highly dynamic, programmable lighting installations. This allows for pixel-level control, color-changing effects, and synchronization with audio-visual systems in arenas and theme parks." },
  { id: "ent2", question: "Can you supply lighting for family entertainment centers (FECs)?", answer: "Absolutely. We have extensive experience delivering lighting for FECs across the GCC, including brands like Funtura and Xtreme Zone. We provide a mix of high-energy RGBW lighting for gaming areas and comfortable architectural lighting for concourses and dining zones." },
  { id: "ent3", question: "How do you handle lighting for large scale facades and arenas?", answer: "We use high-output, IP66-rated exterior floodlights and direct-view LED pixels. These systems are designed to withstand extreme weather conditions while delivering synchronized, large-scale media facade content." },
  { id: "ent4", question: "What is the lifespan of your dynamic LED installations?", answer: "Our commercial-grade entertainment fixtures utilize high-quality LEDs (such as Osram or Cree) and robust drivers, typically offering lifespans of 50,000 to 100,000 hours, even under rigorous daily operation." }
