  { id: "ol1", question: "What is Human Centric Lighting (HCL) in an office?", answer: "Human Centric Lighting involves using tunable white LEDs to mimic the natural progression of daylight. By providing cooler, brighter light in the morning for alertness and warmer, dimmer light in the late afternoon, HCL helps maintain employees' natural circadian rhythms, boosting productivity and well-being." },
  { id: "ol2", question: "What is the standard lux level for an open plan office?", answer: "According to global lighting standards, general open-plan office desks should have an illuminance of 500 lux. However, the surrounding areas like corridors can be kept around 200-300 lux to create visual hierarchy and save energy." },
  { id: "ol3", question: "How do you prevent glare on computer screens?", answer: "We utilize fixtures with a UGR (Unified Glare Rating) of less than 19. These fixtures feature specialized micro-prismatic diffusers or deep reflectors that ensure the light is directed downwards without reflecting off monitors or causing eye strain." },
  { id: "ol4", question: "Can office lighting help achieve LEED or WELL certification?", answer: "Yes. Our high-efficiency LED solutions, combined with daylight harvesting sensors and HCL strategies, contribute significantly to points under both the LEED (Energy & Atmosphere) and WELL (Light Concept) building standards." }
