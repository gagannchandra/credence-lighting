  { id: "rak1", question: "Do you provide lighting for coastal resorts and beach hotels in RAK?", answer: "Yes, Ras Al Khaimah's booming coastal tourism requires lighting that can withstand high humidity and salt spray. As specialized lighting suppliers in Ras Al Khaimah, we supply marine-grade, 316L stainless steel and anodized aluminum fixtures specifically designed for beachfront environments." },
  { id: "rak2", question: "Can you design lighting that minimizes light pollution for mountain resorts?", answer: "Absolutely. For eco-tourism projects in the Hajar Mountains, we employ 'Dark Sky' compliant lighting strategies. We use heavily shielded, low-glare fixtures that illuminate pathways safely without obscuring the natural starlight." },
  { id: "rak3", question: "What smart controls do you recommend for large resorts?", answer: "We recommend a hybrid approach: DALI for precise indoor control of ballrooms and lobbies, combined with Casambi wireless mesh networks for outdoor landscape lighting, reducing the need for extensive trenching and cabling." }
