  { id: "bh1", question: "Do you supply lighting to Bahrain from the UAE?", answer: "Yes, we regularly export and supply lighting packages to Bahrain. Thanks to the GCC customs union and our established logistics providers, we ensure rapid and cost-effective delivery via the King Fahd Causeway." },
  { id: "bh2", question: "Are your fixtures suitable for Bahrain's high humidity?", answer: "Absolutely. Bahrain's island geography means exterior lighting must be highly resistant to humidity and salt. As an experienced lighting supplier, we specify IP66/IP67 rated fixtures with anti-corrosion marine-grade treatments specifically for these environments." },
  { id: "bh3", question: "Can you assist with the lighting design for my project in Manama?", answer: "Yes, our in-house design team provides comprehensive lighting calculations (DIALux), 3D renderings, and AutoCAD layouts for projects located anywhere in Bahrain." }
